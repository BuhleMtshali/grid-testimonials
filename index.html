            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
            got every penny's worth.

            "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been
            looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
            amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
            found it incredibley fun! I enrolled shortly therafter. The next 12
            weeks was the best - and most grueilly - time of my life. Since
            completeing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working
            as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

            "Before joining the boootcamp, I've never written a line a code, I
            needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
            programming step by step. I was encoraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
            program. The entire curriculum and start did not dissapoint. The
            agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
            learning to the level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In
            fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of
            my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
            full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers, 100%
            recommend!"
