            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
            got every penny's worth.

            "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been
            looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
            amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
            found it incredibley fun! I enrolled shortly therafter. The next 12
            weeks was the best - and most grueilly - time of my life. Since
            completeing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working
            as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."
